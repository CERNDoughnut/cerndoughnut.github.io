# Marinaded Stir-fry Tofu

This versatile tofu can be added to many dishes to spice things up with some healthy, vegan protein! My favourite combo is to add some red, orange or yellow peppers and spring onion but feel free to put your own spin on it by adding your own favourite veg!

The tofu is best left to marinade in the fridge overnight so it soaks up the most flavour. It should last in the fridge (in a sealed container) for about a week, but your mileage may vary.

>**Protip**: You can also use the marinade as a stir-fry sauce!

## Ingredients

### Basic

- 280g firm or very firm tofu, drained (I like to use [Naked Tofoo](https://tofoo.co.uk/products?type=tofoo-blocks))
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce (or whatever type of soy sauce you have lying around)
- Good sprinkling of ground black pepper
- Salt, to taste

### Optional extras

- Small squeeze of BBQ sauce (I use [Heinz](https://www.heinz.co.uk/sauces/product/100185200001/classic-barbecue-sauce), 0.5 serving)
- Chilli seeds/chilli powder/fresh chillies (chopped finely) or something else spicy, to taste

>**Other ideas (I don't usually put these in but they sound tasty)**: garlic, ginger, lime juice, hot sauce, chopped peanuts, crunchy peanut butter...

### Prep these on the day (also optional)

- 0.5-1 red/orange/yellow pepper, chopped into ~3cm strips (I just cut the full strip in half)
- 3-4 spring onions, chopped into ~1cm chunks at an angle (so they look cooler and give off more flavour)

## Method

### The night before (if possible - if not, at least a couple of hours before)

- Chop the tofu into ~3cm tall batons, with a square cross section of about 0.5-1cm.

>If you are using Tofoo, chop the block in half and then cut the strips from that.

- Put them in a sealable container.
- Over the top, pour/sprinkle the sauce ingredients (everything in the Basic and Optional Extras sections above).
- Close the lid of the container (**make sure it is leak-proof!**) and shake like you're making cocktails (dancing optional but encouraged).
- Leave in the fridge to marinade.

### On the day

- Heat a frying pan to a medium-high heat.
- Throw in the tofu mix (including all the sauce from the box) and the pepper.
- Stir occasionally.

>The aim here is to get a good level of caramelisation on all sides of the tofu. Initially it may look a bit wet but the sauce will reduce and leave you with lovely, slightly crunchy tofu and lightly charred peppers.

- When the tofu looks golden/dark brown (see the picture for this recipe), throw in the spring onions and stir in, then take off the heat.

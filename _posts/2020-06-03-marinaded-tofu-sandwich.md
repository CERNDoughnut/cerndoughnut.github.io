# Marinaded Tofu Sandwich

This recipe makes use of the base marinaded tofu recipe. You can use any type of bread (or skip it entirely!) but for best results I'd recommend a freshly baked, crusty roll or a bake-at-home petit pain.

>**Makes 1 serving**

> For nutrition info, add the base marinaded tofu recipe numbers to whatever bread, condiments and side salad you choose.

## Ingredients (guideline - add ingredients you love to mix it up!)

- 1 serving of the marinaded stir-fry tofu recipe (I like to include the peppers and spring onions)
- Bake at home petit pain or fresh, crusty bread roll
- Salad leaves
- Baby plum or cherry tomatoes
- Mayonnaise

>**Other ideas**: jalape√±os, carrot (pickled or otherwise), cucumber, mustard/other sauces, cheese...

## Method

- If using bake-at-home bread, preheat the oven and get your bread in there!
- Whilst it is baking, cook up a portion of the marinaded stir-fry tofu with your choice of veg.
- Once both the bread and tofu are cooked, cut the roll in half (I recommend leaving the halves connected) and fill with salad.
- On top, place a good helping of the tofu mixture and a little mayonnaise.
- On the side, make up a salad with some more leaves, the rest of the tofu mixture and the tomatoes (and anything else you like!)
- Enjoy!
